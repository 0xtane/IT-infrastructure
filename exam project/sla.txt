RPO (acceptable data loss)
(RPO) determines the maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time. For example, the maximum tolerable data loss is in our case would be 24 hours.

Retention
the backed up data is stored on the servers for 30 days , must be atleast 2 different locations

Usability
The backups are ready for deployment, only if the integrity of the data is intact, so they need to be tested before hand.

Restoration Criteria
Feel free to restore any kind of backup if you have a reasonable doubt about the data being manipulated or in case of itâ€™s partial/full loss.

Recovery time objective
depending on the load of network and the size of the data to be stored, can be under a minute  or sometimes few minutes
